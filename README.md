### Project Description:
(This assignment was mainly about utilizing the tax calculator application to find the IRS tax bracket for a user. I had to reference elements on a web page using the ID value, associated an event with an HTML element to define an event handler, and used if, if/else and nested if statements in order to make decisions.)

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned that the decision making process is more than just saying yes or no, but it is about determining an order in which statements should be placed in order to execute a program. This is not just as simple as the different decision-making ways, there are decision-making statements, structures and conditional statements. These are all special types of JavaScript statements that are used to make decisions. For example, if statements, if/else statements or nested if statements.)
2. (An if statement is used to execute specific programming code if conditional expression evaluation returns truthy value. An if/else statement executes one action if the condition is true and a different action is the condition is false. A nested if statement is an if statement contained within an if statement or winin an if/else statement. A nested if/else statement is an if/e'se statement contained within an if statement or within an if/else statement.)
3. (A function is a related group of javascript statements that are executed as a single unit. They are virtually identical to methods but not associated with an object, and must be contained within a script element. There are different types of functions such as named and anonymous. Named functions are related statements that are assigned to a name such as a call or reference named function to execute it. Ths is used when you want to reuse code. An anonymous function is a related statement without an assigned name that works only where they are located in code. You use these functions for code that runs only once.)
